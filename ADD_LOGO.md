# 🎨 Adding Your ARCUS Logo

## Quick Setup:

1. **Save your ARCUS logo image** as `logo.png` in the `frontend` folder
2. The logo should be:
   - White/light colored (will show on black background)
   - Transparent background preferred
   - PNG format recommended
   - Size: ~120px wide, auto height (or about 32-40px tall)

3. **The app will automatically:**
   - Display your logo image if `logo.png` exists
   - Fall back to styled "ARCUS" text if image is missing

## Logo Location:
```
frontend/logo.png
```

## Current Fallback:
If no logo image is found, the app shows "ARCUS" in a gothic-style white text with a subtle glow, matching your brand aesthetic.

The logo appears in the navbar at the top of the app.
